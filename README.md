Foundation is a Sponge plugin which establishes a plugin infrastructure. It defines a set of APIs and implementations, such as general classes and methods and economy, but also helper classes and methods for other plugins.

Foundation is not a usable plugin by itself. We are creating Foundation-dependent plugins which can add core functionality to your server, like commands for server administration, survival-and creative servers, economy and such.
